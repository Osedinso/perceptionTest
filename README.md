# perceptionTest
This is a program that implements a simple java GUI called jOptionPane
It involves the use of cards similar to the Zener cards
Thr program flow is as follows:
1.Ask the user to select which aspect they wish to test: 
shape, color or both. This can only be done at the 
beginning of the program. 
2. After type of test is chosen, the user is prompted to guess the generated cards
3.The program keeps track of the number of correct guesses they make. If 
they are doing both the color and the shape, it tracks the number of shapes they get right, the number of colors that
get right and the number of times they get both correct on 
one card. 
4. After 5 cards,the program reports the running total of the results
5. If the user wants to continue, do another 5 cards.
